## Bond Coding Test
~by Carl Welch

Thanks guys. This was a really fun test. 

I would have used redux and react-router, but this was my first time using create-react-app. Normally I would use react-redux-starter-kit, which I've been using for a couple years. Except, when I went to the repo today, I discovered the owner depreciated it and suggested create-react-app, which I did. I did end up ejecting it, for your convienence and I suspect if I were to continue working on this project, this would be the point where I would begin adding redux and react-router, but 2 hours is tight!

Anyway, run just do:

if you have yarn installed, which I really dig, do this:
```
yarn install
```

then 
```
yarn start
```

NPM:
```
npm install
```
then 
```
npm start
```

Cheers!
